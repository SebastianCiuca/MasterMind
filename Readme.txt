MasterMind


1. Title: MasterMind
2. Description:
	With this mobile application, I intend on creating a “planner” - something that helps with organizational matters, such as: keeping notes and checklists, storing images and locations, with the added functionalities of filters, categories, color codes, and some form of prioritizing. Possibly other functionalities will be later added. 
	You can log into the application in order to persist your data over multiple devices, as well as being able to create private notes. Persistance means, when the account is activated, that any change on one of the devices, is visible on the other device(s). Also, certain notes will have deadlines. When these deadlines pass, a notification will be displayed.
